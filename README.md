## Project Overview
As **Data Science Intern - Team Lead** for the Spring 2025 Internship class at [IDX Exchange](https://www.linkedin.com/company/idxexchange/posts/?feedView=all), I led a team in developing predictive models for real estate prices using California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS) data.

### ðŸš€ **Random Forest Modeling (Sole Ownership)**
- **Developed end-to-end Random Forest (RF) pipeline** from feature engineering to deployment, achieving **RÂ²=0.89** on test data.  
- **Implemented K-Fold CV** (`n_splits=5`) to ensure robust performance estimates
- **Delivered business-ready outputs**: Interpreted feature importance and created visualizations for stakeholders.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### ðŸŽ¯ Predictive Modeling Leadership
- Led the development and evaluation of machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression) using CRMLS real estate data
- Improved forecasting accuracy through strategic feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
- Designed the project roadmap and coordinated team tasks using Agile methodologies
- Presented final recommendations to IDX leadership

### ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Assessed and compared model performance using key metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared Score
- Developed model selection framework to balance accuracy and computational efficiency
- Created visualization dashboards to communicate model performance to non-technical stakeholders

#### Evaluation Metrics on Test Set

| Model             | MAE    | MSE     | RMSE   | RÂ²     |
|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| LASSO            | 0.0251 | 0.00195 | 0.0442 | 0.8414 |
| Random Forest    | 0.1131 | 0.0295  | 0.1718 | 0.8907 |
| Gradient Boosting| 0.0931 | 0.0167  | 0.1291 | 0.9074 |
| XGBoost          | 0.096  | 0.019   | 0.138  | 0.938  |

### ðŸš€ Presentation & Stakeholder Communication
- Directed final project presentations, structuring the narrative for maximum business impact
- Translated technical findings into actionable recommendations
